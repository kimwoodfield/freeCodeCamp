// Add the appropriate import statement that will allow the current file to use the uppercaseString and lowercaseString functions you exported in the previous lesson. These functions are in a file called string_functions.js, which is in the same directory as the current file.

import { uppercaseString, lowercaseString } from './string_functions.js'; // my code imports the two previous functions from a different file
// Only change code above this line

uppercaseString("hello");
lowercaseString("WORLD!");
