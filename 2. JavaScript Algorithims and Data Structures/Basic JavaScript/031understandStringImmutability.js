// Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.

/* // Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line
myStr[0] = "H"; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line */

myStr = "Hello World";
// String immutability means that once I string has been given to a variable, that string cannot be edited with things like bracket notation. In order to chat what exists in a variable like this, a new variable needs to be declared.
