// Build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.
// var myStr; // Only change this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
// Multiple strings can be stored in the same variable by using the '+' operator.
// The above variable 'myStr' will now be printed as "This is the start. This is the end.". Remember to be mindful of spacing.
