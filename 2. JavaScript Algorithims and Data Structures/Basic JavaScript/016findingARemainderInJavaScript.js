// Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.
// var remainder;

var remainder = 11 % 3; // 3 can fit into 11 three times before it can't fit in anymore times. At three times, there is only 2 left over, so the value of 2 is now stored in the variable 'remainder'.
