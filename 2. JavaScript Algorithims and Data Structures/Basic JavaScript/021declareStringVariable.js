// Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

var myFirstName = "John"; // The variable 'myFirstName' has now been assigned a vakue of John.
var myLastName = "Doe"; // The variable 'myLastName' has now been assigned a vakue of Doe.

// A String is a data type that just usually means a word made of letters.
