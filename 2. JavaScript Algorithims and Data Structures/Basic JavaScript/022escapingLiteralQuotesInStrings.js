/* Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes". 

var myStr = ""; // Change this line*/

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; 
// When trying a string, you need to use quotation marks to ensure that the value is interpreted as a string.
// Sometimes this can cause errors when you need to use quotation marks within that string, so a good way to avoid any errors like this is using a backslash just before eating additional quotation mark that could otherwise cause bugs.
