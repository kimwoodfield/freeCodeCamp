// Create a function timesFive that accepts one argument, multiplies it by 5, and returns the new value. See the last line in the editor for an example of how you can test your timesFive function.

function timesFive(num) { // Created a function called timesFive that takes in ONE value.
    return num * 5; // the value taken in the parantheses when the function is called will be multiplied by 5, and returned. Normally, if a function is executed but not returned, it will still execute but we will not be able to see its results.
